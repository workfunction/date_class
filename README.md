# OOP Homework #1 

### Introduction
In this homework, your goal is to implement a Date class that allows moving forward and backward of a date. For example, given a date, Jan. 13, 2014, what is the date 50 days after it? You also have to show what day is a date (such as Tuesday or Friday), and print the whole month of a date on the screen. To facilitate grading, a header file declaring the class and a sample main function are attached. You have to make sure that your implementation can run smoothly and correctly.

### Requirement
1. Implement all constructors and methods we declared in class Date. See the attached code for a complete list of functions. 
2. Do NOT revise any member we declared including their parameters, return types, etc. 
3. However, you can add some functions to help your implementation if necessary. 

### Grading
We will use a series of test data to judge if your functions can work correctly. Your score will be based on the number of test data your program can process. We have included some example in the main function for you to test your program. 

### Submission
1.	Upload the following 2 files to e3: StudentID_Date.h, StudentID_Date.cpp
2.	Ensure that your filenames fulfill the above-mentioned format.

### Deadline
-	Normal deadline: 2017/3/23 (Fri.) 23:59:59 
-	Second deadline: 2017/3/30 (Fri.) 23:59:59 [WITH PANALTY!] 

### Penalty
-	Late submission (after 3/23 and before 3/30): 30% discount (your_score = original_score*0.7) 
-	Wrong file name: minus 10 points
-	Copy code from others/internet: 0
